<strong>Introduction</strong><br />
Every time when I visit CS office hours, it took me a really long time to see each course’s office hour, the name of
the course producers, and whether it is currently available or not. So, I decided to make a single website that
can display all CS core courses' office hours into a single project. My project shows the office hour schedule for
all core computer science major classes at the University of Southern California. This schedule viewer covers CS
103, CS 104, EE 109, CS 201, CS 270, and last but not least, ITP 303! Main homepage displays today’s top
headline news using News API along with general course information, important dates, useful links, and course
schedule. Course page has course description and instructors’ contact information. Schedule page is the main
page where you can see your current enrolled classes (if logged in) with CP schedule by clicking each course
button. Below, there is a search form that you can specifically search for day, course, CP name, or location.
Profile page shows user’s credentials. User can update their records or delete their account in profile page. Last,
login & signup page implements login functionality. Sign up page has password recommendation button so that
user can create a random password easily.
